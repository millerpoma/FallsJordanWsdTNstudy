There are two items in this repository: 

1)	RStaninputdata_05_20212021-05-10.rds- This is a R data file that needs to be imported into R with the appropriate command. 

2)	Github_code- RStan code needed to run the code. We ran the code within R Studio. RStan needs to be installed correctly first into R and we used both the “rstan” and “rstudioapi” packages. In future years, this compatibility might be different.
